Title: "Commit-ment Issues: A Git-tastrophe in Silicon Valley"

In the heart of Silicon Valley, four coders—Liam, Priya, Dave, and Zoe—formed a startup called Commitment Issues, aiming to revolutionize pet grooming with AI. Their motto: “We’ll untangle your dog’s fur… but not our codebase.”

Chapter 1: The Accidental git push --force Heist
On launch day, Priya, the "Move Fast and Break Things" frontend dev, decided to "clean up" the repo. She force-pushed her experimental-branch-that-definitely-works to main, vaporizing six months of work. The team stared at the terminal in horror. “It’s fine!” Priya chirped. “I saved my code… on my laptop’s Notes app… maybe?”

CEO Liam, who thought git was short for “guitar,” tried to undo the damage by smashing his keyboard like a caffeinated raccoon. The repo’s commit history now read: “uh oh,” “seriously uh oh,” and “hiring a priest to exorcise git.”

Chapter 2: The Merge Conflict Apocalypse
Zoe, the backend dev, insisted on rebasing everything. “It’ll linearize our history!” she declared. Two days later, the team was trapped in merge conflict hell. The AI now classified poodles as "database errors," and the app’s logo was replaced with Zoe’s angry rant about semicolons.

Meanwhile, Dave, the paranoid intern, cloned the repo 37 times “for backup.” His desktop looked like a digital graveyard of project-final-v3-FINAL2 folders.

Chapter 3: The Case of the Missing .gitignore
To “boost productivity,” Liam banned “non-essential” files from the repo. Unfortunately, nobody added a .gitignore, so the repo ballooned with node_modules, Dave’s mixtape.mp3, and 8,000 cat memes. When AWS sent a $10,000 bill for storage, Priya tried to git rm --cached the internet.

Chapter 4: git blame Becomes Literal
During a heated Zoom call, Zoe git blamed Dave for breaking the login page. Dave retaliated by git reverting Zoe’s coffee machine API. Liam mediated by sharing a Medium article titled “Git for Babies,” which only confused everyone more.

Epilogue: The Post-It Note Paradigm
After their repo became sentient and tried to git push to the Pentagon, the team switched to a “hybrid cloud solution”: sticky notes on Liam’s wall. They went viral on TikTok as “the startup that unironically uses SCRUM.”

Moral of the story?
“git gud… or just wing it and hope VCs don’t notice.”

THE END
(P.S. Their AI now grooms virtual pets. And squirrels. It’s a work in progress.)
