# <h1> how_to_git
this is a new repo where we explore the options of working as a team on github.  
to contribute to a repo we first clone the repo to work localy.  
eg. git clone https://github.com/peer-network/how_to_git.git  
afterwards we create a new branch and give it a descriptive name.  
eg. git checkout -b modify_readme  
it would be even better when we provide our username aswell so a better name would've been.
